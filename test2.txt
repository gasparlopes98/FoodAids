Season the steaks with garlic, paprika, salt, and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over high heat.

Add the steaks to the skillet and cook them for 2-3 minutes on each side or until they reach your desired level of doneness. Remove them from the skillet and set them aside.

In the same skillet, melt the butter and fry the eggs to your desired level of doneness.

Add the red wine vinegar to the skillet and stir to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for a minute.

Serve the steaks on a plate with fries, rice, and salad. Place a fried egg on top of each steak and drizzle the pan sauce over the top.
